        <h5><b>What's included in the Developer plan?</b></h5>
        <p>
          Everything you need to quickly get started building APIs and services. 
          Including your own namespace, deploy from git, automatic builds and 
          public API urls.
        </p>
        <h5><b>Can I use the developer plan for my team?</b></h5>
          Yes. You shoud be able to invite upto 5 collaborators to your namespace. 
          You'll share the resources of a single namespace and be able to build 
          and manage services together.
        <p>
        <h5><b>What's the resource limits</b></h5>
          Each namespace is under a fair usage policy of 1 core, 1gb memory and 10gb 
          disk. The business plan increases the resource limits 2x by default and 
          beyond for a cost.

        <h5><b>Where is it hosted?</b></h5>
          M3O is hosted on DigitalOcean in the London region.
        <p>
        <h5><b>Can I self host Micro?</b></h5>
          Yes Micro is open source or "source available". You can find it on 
          <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">GitHub</a>. Micro uses the 
          <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/">Polyform Shield</a> 
          License which just means you can't sell Micro as a service.
