		  In the near future we're looking to offer <b>Team</b> and <b>Enterprise</b> tiers to cover the 
		  scaling needs of developers and companies on the platform.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		  Our goal at Micro is to provide a secure, stable and scalable platform for you to build products 
		  and services in the cloud without having to think about the infrastructure.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		  We'll also look to provide other value add services on top so you don't have to build or manage 
		  them yourself. Contact us to learn more now.
