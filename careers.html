        At Micro Services Inc we believe that writing, deploying, and running code has become too complex. We want to
        strip away all the excess and get developers focused back on the code and not the plumbing. Weâ€™re building M3O
        (pronounced "em-three-oh"); a cloud platform for microservices development (https://m3o.com/). A fully managed
        service which lets developers focus on writing code rather than managing the infrastructure.
