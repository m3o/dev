At Micro Services Inc we believe that writing, deploying, and running code has become too complex. We want to strip away all the excess and get developers focused back on the code and not the plumbing. We’re building M3O (pronounced "em-three-oh"); a cloud platform for microservices development (https://m3o.com/). A fully managed service which lets developers focus on writing code rather than managing the infrastructure.

We’re looking for an engineer to help make our vision a reality for the world’s developer community. You’ll be joining a small, friendly team of engineers who are excited about defining and building the next model of cloud development. Everyone is given a high level of trust and autonomy to deliver their best work. This doesn’t mean you’ll be working in isolation though; we have a wide range of experience within the team from startups to agencies to corporates and everything in between so if you need to ask questions or want to bounce ideas off someone else we’ve got you covered.


### What's the tech stack?

We use a wide range of technologies including:
- Next.js and Angular for frontends
- HTTP and gRPC APIs
- Jamstack architecture
- Netlify web hosting
- Go on the backend - in particular the OSS Micro framework (https://github.com/micro/micro) of which we are the primary owners/maintainers
- Kubernetes and Docker in the cloud

You don’t need to have experience with all of the above; just be open and excited to learn new things and improve the skills you already have.

### What will you be working on? 

Primarily focused on building out our web facing experiences including the website, dashboard and any single purpose apps or demos. You'll lead the frontend and web consumption angle. 
We need someone who has a good eye for design and understands how to build modular frontends that include next.js, netlify and the jamstack.

We’re a remote only company but we try to keep collaboration high through frequent video calls, instant messaging, design docs and pull requests. We follow (loosely) the agile process with two week sprints, daily standups, sprint demos and planning. We’re still learning though and hope you can bring your ideas to add to and improve our company culture and ways of working.


### What benefits do you offer?
- Stock options (you’ll own a piece of the pie)
- 25 days of annual leave (+ public holidays)
- Pension scheme
- Flexible working hours

If you have any questions or you’re unsure about applying, please get in contact anyway.

### Interested?
If you're interested or have any questions please email our CTO, dom [at] m3o.com with an up to date CV and any relevant links (github, etc).
